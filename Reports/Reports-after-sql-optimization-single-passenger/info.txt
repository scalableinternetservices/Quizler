Look at the simple.xml file in folder to see the content of load test.
Both of those tests were executed with a DB of 10,000 users, 210,000 friendships, 10,000 quizzes, 80,000 questions.
With about 40 friendships per user.

The tests used the app at the commit f1f8f7826599841220712ed7b7f5600569e35387 on branch optimizeSQLqueries.

It contains SQL optimizations for all pages and also optimization of sign in and sign up pages where we removed some unnecessary calls in views for unused links (devise calls)
