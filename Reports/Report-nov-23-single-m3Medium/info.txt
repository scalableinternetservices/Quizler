CHANGES
All the SQL queries were optimized (use of includes or single query in search users by joining users and friendships tables)
Removal of unnecessary code and links in views of sign in page
Removed sign in process in the load testing file, both for the game flow and for browsing quizzes - to make the flow more realistic and because the sign in phase is a bottleneck.

RESULT
No significant changes.
